# One Poster Wonder 💭

A daily design challenge to improve your Adobe Illustrator skills by creating unique and fun posters every day! The goal is to push my creativity, learn new techniques, and build a diverse portfolio of designs over time.

---

## What’s the Plan?  
Here’s what I’m going to do:
1. **Design one poster every day** in Adobe Illustrator. It could be something random, a design challenge, or just an idea I’m feeling that day.  
2. **Upload my work** to this repo. I’ll store my .ai files and export them as .png or .jpg so I can see how my designs evolve over time.
3. **Reflect and evolve**: Every day, I’m going to learn something new, whether it’s mastering a tool, playing with color schemes, or improving my overall composition. The goal is to improve, even if it’s just a little each day.

## Why Am I Doing This? (aka the Big Picture)
- **Master Illustrator**: The goal is to become so familiar with Illustrator that I don’t even think about it anymore.
- **Build a killer portfolio**: 100 posters—one for every single day of the year (minus 265 days). That’s a ton of diverse, creative work!
- **Have fun**: It’s not about perfection. This challenge is all about **play**, **growth**, and **creativity**. The process should be as enjoyable as the result.
- **Track my progress**: Looking back at my designs at the end of the year will show me just how far I’ve come.

## What to Expect (aka Spoiler Alert)
- **Good days**: Some posters will come out *amazing*. I’ll have those "wow, I did that?" moments.
- **Bad days**: Some days, my design might look like it belongs in the trash. That’s okay. Tomorrow is another day.
- **A whole lot of learning**: I’ll pick up tricks, shortcuts, and design concepts that’ll make me a faster, more confident designer.

## My Daily Rules (aka Keep It Simple)
- **One poster a day**: It doesn’t have to be perfect, it just has to exist. Consistency is key.
- **No excuses**: Even if I’m tired or busy, I’m going to get at least a design in. Even if it’s a quick doodle.
- **Get weird**: Experiment with new techniques. Try things outside my comfort zone.
- **No judgment**: Perfection isn’t the goal. The point is **growth** and **learning**.

## How I’m Using This Repo
1. Every day, I’ll create a new Illustrator file and upload it to the **posters/** directory. In addition, I'll crate a new markdown file and upload it to the **reflection/** directory.
2. I’ll name my files like this:`dayX.ai` (e.g., `day1.ai`) and `dayX_reflection.md` (e.g., `day1_reflection.md`).
3. I’ll export a high-res .png or .jpg version and upload that too.  
4. I’ll commit my work each day and keep pushing forward.

## The Endgame (aka Why It’s Worth It)
- **Growth**: By the end of this, I’ll be a much better designer. My skills will be unrecognizable from where they are now.
- **A massive portfolio**: I’ll have 100 posters at the end of this project. That’s a ton of creative work to show off or use in future projects.
- **Self-satisfaction**: I’ll look back at this and think, “I did that.” It’ll be one of the most rewarding things I’ve ever done.

## Ready to Dive In? 🚀
Time to get started! I’ll grab Illustrator and begin with Day 1. No matter what happens, I’m going to keep creating. It’s going to be a blast. 🔥
